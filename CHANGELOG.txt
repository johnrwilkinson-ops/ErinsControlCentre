ECC CLEANUP — 2025-09-09 09:39

- Removed Snapshot UI and code:
  • Deleted <button id="shareSnapshot"> and its event handler.
  • Removed shareSnapshotLink() function.
  • Scrubbed residual references to #shareSnapshot and textual “Snapshot”.

- Removed debug lock-bypass CSS/JS blocks.

- Kept working pieces:
  • ecc-live-sync-v6 (state posting) intact.
  • ecc-control-listener-v2 intact (Control4 button mapping + notes sync).

- Serverless functions:
  • c4-state.mjs: deduplicated mmss() helper; single top-level definition now.

- Housekeeping:
  • companion-notes-render.js removed from bundle (unused by companion.html).
